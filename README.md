## About

ConvDO is a **Convolutional Differential Operator** designed for Physics-based deep learning study. It can be used to calculate the spatial derivative of a field.

## Installation

* Install through pip: `pip install git+https://github.com/qiauil/ConvDO`
* Install locally: Download the repository and run `./install.sh` or `pip install .`

## Feature

Positive😀 and negative🙃 things are all features... 

* PyTorch-based and only supports 2D fields at the moment.
* Powered by convolutional neural network.
* Differentiable and GPU supported (why not? It's PyTorch based!).
* Second order for Dirichlet and Neumann boundary condition.
* Up to 8th order for periodic boundary condition.
* Obstacles inside of the domain is supported.
